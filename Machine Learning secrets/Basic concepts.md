# Machine Learning
* computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed
## major ML techniques
1. regression/estimation:predicting continuous values
2. classficiation:predicting the item class/category of a case
3. clustering: find the structure of data
4. associations: finding items/events that ofer co-occur
5. Anomaly decetion: discovering abnormal and unusual cases
6. Sequence mining:predicting next events
7. Dimension reduction: reducing the size of data(PCA)
8. Recommendation systems: recommending items

## Difference between AI, ML an deep learning
* AL tries to make computers intelligent in order to mimic the cognitive functions of humans
* ML: branch of AL that covers statistical part, teach computer by looking at hundreds of examples
* DL: special part of ML, computer can learn an make intelligent decisions on their own

## Python in ML
* Main modules and libraries
1. Numpy: a math library to work with N-dimensional array
2. Scipy: a collection of numerical algorithms
3. Matplotlib: plotting package that provides 2D/3D plotting\
4. Pandas: provide easy to use data structure
5. Scikit-learn: a collections of basic ML algorithms

## Supervised VS Unsupervised
* Supervised: supervise ML model
1. classificaition
2. Regression
* Unsupervised:
1. Dimension reduction
2. Density estimation: explore data to find some structure within it
3. Market basket analysis
4. Clustering
