# Basic conception
* Categorizing items into a discrete set of "classes"
* Target attribute is a categorical variable

# Classification algorithms
1. Decision Trees
2. Naive Bayes
3. Linear Discriminant Analysis
4. KNN
5. Logistic Regression
6. Neural Networks
7. SVM

# K-Nearest-Neighbours
> Majority vote from K neighbor
1. pick a value for K
2. Calculate the distance of unknown case from all cases
3. Select the k-observations in the training data that are 'nearest' the unknown data point
4. predict the unknown point by most popular label
## K choice
* low: overfitting
* high: underfitting
* solutions: choose K equals one and then using accuracy to determine

## Evaluation metrics in Classification
1. Jaccard index
