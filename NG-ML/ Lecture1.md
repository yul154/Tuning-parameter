# Machine Learning 

## Definition: 
* fields of study that gives computer the ability to learn without being explicity programmed
* Supervised learning: suprevising the algorithm to learn by answer
* Regression: the variable we are trying to  predict is continuous value
* Classfication: the variable we are trying to predict is discrete value
* Learning theory: a master carpenter will be able to use those tools far better than most of us in this room
* Unsupervised Learning:  find structure in the data in the form of the data
* Reinforcement learning(reward function): 
  1. enables an agent to learn in an interactive environment by trial and error using feedback from its own actions and experiences.
  2. it as a wayto specify whay you want done,hen it's up to the learning algorithm to figure out how to maximize good reward signals and minimize the bad punishments.
